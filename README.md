# Travel-Tracker-Solo-Project

By: Ashley McDonald

## Project Overview

This was the final solo project for Module 2 of the Turing School of Software & Design's Front-End Engineering Program. In this project, I used OOP to drive the design of the application & code to create an application that allows users to login, book a trip from a list of destinations, & view their travel history.

The goals per the project spec:
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

##Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Fetch API
- Webpack
- Mocha Framework & Chai Libary for testing
- Git/GitHub
